<h1>Here's a comparison of MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB and SQLite : </h1>

<h2>Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS)</h2>

 MySQL

1. Open-source: Free and community-driven
2. Popular: Widely used in web applications (e.g., WordPress, Facebook)
3. Easy to use: Simple syntax and intuitive interface
4. Scalable: Supports large databases and high traffic
5. Supported by Oracle

2. PostgreSQL

1. Open-source: Free and community-driven
2. Powerful: Advanced features (e.g., window functions, common table expressions)
3. Reliable: Robust and fault-tolerant
4. Compliant with SQL standards
5. Supports JSON, XML and spatial data

3. MariaDB

1. Open-source: Forked from MySQL (2009)
2. Improved performance: Faster query execution and better indexing
3. Enhanced security: Improved encryption and access control
4. Compatibility: Drop-in replacement for MySQL
5. Supported by MariaDB Foundation

4. SQLite

1. Open-source: Self-contained, file-based database
2. Lightweight: Low memory footprint and fast execution
3. Portable: Cross-platform compatibility
4. Easy to use: Simple syntax and minimal setup
5. Embedded database: Suitable for mobile apps, IoT devices and desktop applications

3. Embedded systems: SQLite (portability and lightweight)
4. High-performance: MariaDB or PostgreSQL (optimized query execution)
5. Simple projects: SQLite or MySQL (easy to use and quick setup)

Ultimately, consider factors such as:

1. Project requirements
2. Development expertise
3. Scalability needs
4. Security concerns
5. Community support
